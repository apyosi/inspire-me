        <p class="description">Arnold Schwarzenegger broke the internet with this motivational & inspirational speech.
          Arnold talked about
          the six rules about success and what people need to focus on in order to succeed. If you feel like quitting
          or
          giving up, this speech will make you rethink your perspective. Schwarzenegger says you have to work hard in
          order to get to your goals because there are no shortcuts to success. It is a long and hard road that you
          need
          to travel in order to achieve your dreams. </p>

        <p class="description">The actor Wentworth Miller talks about his struggles growing up, how alone he felt and
          that whatever you are
          going through there is always someone there to help you in your own hardships.
          Many people out there will be facing depression or bullying but it does not have to be so. You do not have
          to
          live this way, there will always be someone to rescue you. Never pretend to those looking in at you that all
          is okay, talk to them and do not put up a wall.
          You may not believe there is hope, but Wentworth shows us that there most certainly is and that like
          himself,
          telling your story cannot only help yourself but others too in their own struggles.
          We are all together, we are not alone.</p>

          Not everyone needs to go to college to be successful because there are more than just one path to success.
          Many entrepreneurs find that college is not very beneficial when it comes to teaching people how to build a
          business. The education system is built mostly to teach people how to be workers and not build businesses.
          With this said, everyone's situation is different and people need to consider what is beneficial for them.
